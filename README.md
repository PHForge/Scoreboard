# Scoreboard

A retro-style scoreboard management program written in C, inspired by 1980s arcade games. This project allows users to add players, manage scores, display rankings with tie handling, and save/load data to/from a file.

## Features
- **Player Management**: Add players with names (up to 48 characters) and non-negative scores.
- **Ranking System**: Displays rankings with support for ties (ex-aequo) and proper rank progression.
- **File I/O**: Save and load scores to/from `scores.txt` for persistent data.
- **Retro Interface**: ASCII art banner at startup for a nostalgic 1980s arcade feel.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Options to add players, display the scoreboard, view credits, or quit.
- **Input Validation**: Robust handling of invalid inputs (empty names, commas, negative scores, etc.).

## Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Code::Blocks or any IDE/terminal that supports C compilation.
